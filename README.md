# Arducheeso: IOT Project 11 ITM

### About
*One Webinterface, two Arduinos. One server, two clients. Cheese!*

Client + NFC-sensor is sending a "cheese-request" to the server. The server will log this request and trigger an actor (LED, Sound, etc.).

## Workspace Setup

Everything you need to know to setup your workspace.
You'll require a **Windows** or **Mac** operating system for setting up this workspace.

We're using the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) client for our *version control* and [Atom](http://atom.io/) in combination with the [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=atom) for our programming work.

### Used Software 

* [Atom](http://atom.io/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=atom)

---
### Setup GitHub Desktop
**1.** Download and install the [GitHub Desktop]<br(https://desktop.github.com/) client<br>
**2.** Open the client and **log in** to your GitHub account<br>
**3.** Choose **clone repository** and clone the Arducheeso repo<br>
**4.** Select the branch you want to work with<br>
**5.** Hit the **fetch** button right beside the branch menu to download the branch<br>

---
### Setup Atom
This step is quite easy. Just visit [atom.io](http://atom.io/), hit the download button and install it.

### Setup PlatformIO

###### Part 1
***Installation***

**1.** Open Atom and go to the **settings** view (*ctrl+comma*)<br>
**2.** Click on **install** (down left in the settings view)<br>
**3.** Type in '*platformio-ide*' in the search-form<br>
**4.** Install the **PlatformIO IDE**<br>

###### Part 2
***After PlatformIO is installed you can see a additional leftmenu in Atom***

**1.** Click on the *house* to get to the PlatformIO **home**<br>
**2.** Click on **Boards** and type in '*Huzzah*'<br>
**3.** You should see the Adafruit Huzzah. Click on **Espressif 8266** in the platform column<br>
**4.** Then hit the **install** button to add the platform to your PlatformIO IDE<br>
**5.** *Additional hint*: In the libaries section you can add the download the libaries you need<br>

###### Part 3

***Include the project***

**1.** Go to the PlatformIO **home** again<br>
**2.** Click on **open project** <br>
**3.** Navigate to the GitHub folder, you should find it in your computer's document section <br>
**4.** If you want to work on the **server**, open the **server folder** in the *Arducheeso repository*<br>
**5.** If you want to work on the **client**, open the **client folder** in the *Arducheeso repository*<br>
* you can **not** just open the *Arducheeso* folder since you will run into problems with *PlatformIO* doing that.<br>

**6.** **DONE! You're ready to rumble.**
